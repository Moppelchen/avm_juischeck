v1.0.1 (2018/12/24)
-------------------

Fix: JuisCheck would exit silently in case of an unhandled exception. It now
     displays an error message and attempts to copy the exception data to the
     clipboard before exiting.
Fix: A COMException might be thrown when copying image URLs to the clipboard.
     The cause is probably that the clipboard is locked by another program
     (e.g. some tool that monitors the clipboard). JuisCheck now retries
     in case of errors and displays an error message if all attempts fail.
Fix: JuisCheck used Linux style newline (\n) when copying multiple URLs to
     the clipboard instead of Windows style newline (\r\n).
Fix: The tooltips of the Recent and Settings backstage menu buttons would
     also be shown on the panel area. The tooltips are now restricted to the
     button area.
