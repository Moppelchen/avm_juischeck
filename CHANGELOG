v1.2.0 (2018/12/27)
-------------------
New: Support for the legacy jason_boxinfo.xml device information. When a
     request for juis_boxinfo.xml fails with HTTP error 404 (Not Found),
     JuisCheck will make a request for jason_boxinfo.xml. A heuristic is
     used to determine the firmware build type from the Lab element (the
     default is Release).

v1.1.0 (2018/12/25)
-------------------
New: Recent files context menu: open file, remove file from the list.
New: Recent files: button to remove all files from the list.
New: Hide/show datagrid columns via a context menu on the column headers.
New: Datagrid columns for hardware, country, language and update file name
     (hidden by default).
New: Button to reset settings to defaults.
Fix: The device information tooltip on the datagrid was garbled ('Update file
     name' and 'Last checked' fields were in the same row for non-DECT devices).
Change: Base Fritz!OS column is hidden by default.

v1.0.1 (2018/12/24)
-------------------
Fix: JuisCheck would exit silently in case of an unhandled exception. It now
     displays an error message and attempts to copy the exception data to the
     clipboard before exiting.
Fix: A COMException might be thrown when copying image URLs to the clipboard.
     The cause is probably that the clipboard is locked by another program
     (e.g. some tool that monitors the clipboard). JuisCheck now retries
     in case of errors and displays an error message if all attempts fail.
Fix: JuisCheck used Linux style newline (\n) when copying multiple URLs to
     the clipboard instead of Windows style newline (\r\n).
Fix: The tooltips of the Recent and Settings backstage menu buttons would
     also be shown on the panel area. The tooltips are now restricted to the
     button area.
